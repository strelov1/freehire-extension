// The panel's half of one assistant turn, ported from the web app's client
// (`web/src/lib/assistant/client.ts` in the hire repo).
//
// A turn is a single POST whose response body streams the turn as SSE. That is the
// whole transport: no connection held open between turns, no attach, no input
// lease. Cancelling is aborting the fetch — the backend notices its next write fail
// and stops the loop before spending another model call.
//
// Divergence from the web's copy: an absolute origin and a Bearer credential, since
// extension code cannot see hire's httpOnly cookie across origins.
