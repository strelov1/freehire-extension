/**
 * Pins a deterministic extension id, which is what makes the
 * `https://<id>.chromiumapp.org` redirect stable — hire allowlists that id, and
 * `launchWebAuthFlow` fails with "Authorization page could not be loaded" for
 * one it has never heard of.
 *
 * Only the store artifact drops it: the store assigns the id from its own key
 * and a mismatched `key` would fight it. Every other build keeps it, INCLUDING a
 * production `wxt build` — that is the artifact loaded unpacked for testing, and
 * an unpacked extension with no key takes its id from the directory path
 * instead. So the release is marked explicitly rather than inferred from `mode`,
 * which cannot tell the two `wxt build` outputs apart.
 *
 * The published id is a different one, and hire has to allowlist it as well.
