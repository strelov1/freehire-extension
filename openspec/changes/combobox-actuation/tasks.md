## 1. Establish that widgets can be driven at all

- [x] 1.1 Throwaway probe, in a real Chrome with the extension loaded, against the live Stripe and Scout Motors forms: can a react-select be opened, its options read, and one committed with events an injected script can dispatch? Record what each widget responds to.
      **Yes.** `pointerdown`+`mousedown`+`mouseup`+`click` on the `[class*="-control"]` node (not the input) opens it; the same sequence on a `[role="option"]` node commits that option and closes the widget. Verified across Stripe's 13 and Scout's 27 widgets. Two caveats found: React 18 re-renders asynchronously, so opening must be *awaited*, not read back synchronously; and a widget's own listbox is addressed by its `aria-controls` id, which only exists while open — a page-wide `[role=option]` sweep would return a *neighbouring* widget's options.
- [x] 1.2 Find where the committed value is readable — the widget's own displayed value, not the input's `value` — so verification cannot report a success that did not happen.
      The widget's own `[class*="singleValue"]` node. `input.value` is the empty string after a successful commit on every widget probed, and no hidden input mirrors the value. Also: the committed text is not always the option text — the phone-code widget commits `+358` for the option `Åland Islands +358`, so verification compares by one-directional containment (**committed ⊆ selected option**). The reverse direction would let the spike's original failure pass, since `No` ⊆ `Norfolk Island`.
- [x] 1.3 Verdict before building: drivable → continue; not drivable → stop and bring the CDP/`debugger` trade-off back as an explicit decision.
      **VALIDATED** — drivable with ordinary events; the CDP seam stays unpaid. Out-of-scope typeahead widgets identify themselves: they open and offer zero `role=option` nodes (Stripe "Location (City)") or a single "Loading..." node (Scout "School"), so they need no special case.

## 2. Observation: options and grouping

- [x] 2.1 `form.ts`: read a combobox's offered options where they are exposed without opening; report them on the field.
      Read from the listbox the widget's own `aria-controls`/`aria-owns` names — resolved as the id *list* ARIA defines, so a widget pointing at a live-region node beside its listbox still reports its options. A page-wide `[role=option]` sweep would hand a closed question its neighbour's countries on a form of 27 widgets. Options the user cannot see are left out, on the same grounds as hidden controls. A react-select carries none here, having no listbox until opened.
- [x] 2.2 `form.ts`: group controls answering one question (shared `fieldset`/`legend` or equivalently labelled container) into one field carrying the question's label and its options; leave ungrouped anything whose structure is not clearly one question. Unit-test both directions.
      Grouping keys on the container *and* the controls' shared `name` and type: a "Demographic Questions" fieldset wrapping both a Yes/No radio pair and a country checklist asks two questions, and merging them would offer all the options at once and leave the second unanswerable. The "equivalently labelled container" is `role="group"`/`role="radiogroup"` carrying `aria-labelledby`/`aria-label`. Both directions tested, including the four ways grouping declines: text inputs sharing a fieldset, a lone checkbox, a legend-less fieldset, and an unlabelled container.
- [x] 2.3 `read_form` carries the new shape (widget options, grouped field); `fill_simple` fills a grouped field by option text and refuses an option the group does not offer.
      A group reports every already-chosen option as one comma-joined value and accepts that value back, matching the whole string as a single option before splitting it — "Korea, Republic of" is one country, not two the group has never heard of. An option the group does not offer leaves it wholly untouched. Filling ticks and never clears: a group may already carry an answer the user chose by hand.

## 3. `combobox.*` primitives

> Implemented and green, but the code-review pass over this group was cancelled
> before it reported — unlike group 2, these five carry no reviewed-clean stamp.

- [x] 3.1 `combobox.open` — reveal the listbox by label; report open / did-not-open / not-found.
      Presses the widget itself rather than an ancestor matched by class name, since the widget's handler sits on an ancestor and events bubble up to it — `[class*="-control"]` would also match Bootstrap's `form-control` and press the wrong node. Awaits the listbox instead of reading straight back.
- [x] 3.2 `combobox.options` — return the offered option texts; nothing when the widget is not open.
      A closed widget and an open one offering nothing are reported apart, because their remedies differ: the first needs opening, the second is the out-of-scope typeahead. `aria-expanded` outranks the mere presence of a listbox, so a library that keeps its list in the DOM behind `display:none` is not read as open.
- [x] 3.3 `combobox.select` — commit an offered option by acting on the option; refuse a value the widget does not offer.
      Acts on the option node from the widget's own listbox, and waits for the widget to close so a following `verify` reads the committed value rather than the state before it landed.
- [x] 3.4 `combobox.verify` — read back the widget's committed value; a mismatch is a failure, never a fill.
      Compares by containment in one direction — committed ⊆ chosen option — for the reason recorded in 1.2. Reads by walking up from the widget and stopping the moment the subtree holds a second combobox, which makes reporting a *neighbour's* value impossible rather than merely unlikely.
- [x] 3.5 Unit-test the four against a react-select-shaped fixture, including the mismatch path.
      The fixture opens and commits on a *later tick*, so a primitive that merely dispatches-and-reads fails it. Covers the mismatch path with the spike's own case (a question wanting "No" left holding "Norfolk Island"), the shortened-display path ("+358" for "Åland Islands +358"), a widget deaf to dispatched events, and a hidden persistent listbox.

## 4. Agent loop

- [ ] 4.1 For each widget field in the plan: open → options → choose the option the profile justifies → select → verify. An unverified write is reported as not filled.
- [ ] 4.2 Grounding applies to the chosen option exactly as to a typed value; a question the profile does not answer selects nothing.
- [ ] 4.3 The report names each grouped question once, and distinguishes filled / not-yet-fillable / left-for-you.

## 5. Verify

- [ ] 5.1 Extension: `vitest run` + `svelte-check` + `wxt build`; hire: agent tests green.
      Extension green: 109 tests / 11 files, `svelte-check` 999 files 0 errors, `wxt build` 77.88 kB. Hire's agent tests are task group 4's, deliberately out of this session's scope.
- [ ] 5.2 Live end-to-end on the same two Greenhouse forms used as the baseline (Stripe: 4 filled / 13 widgets + 1 group; Scout Motors: 6 filled / 27 widgets). Record the new numbers; nothing is submitted.
      **Observation half measured** by injecting this change's own `form.ts` into both live forms (read-only; nothing filled, nothing submitted). Stripe: 59 controls → **31 questions**, the 29-country question now one field carrying 29 options and `required: true`. Scout Motors: 61 controls → 61 questions, 27 widgets, no groups — it has no checkbox groups to collapse. On both forms **no** widget carries options while closed, so the agent must go through `combobox.open` + `combobox.options`, exactly as designed.
      **Fill half still outstanding**: it needs the agent loop (task group 4, in hire) plus a signed-in panel, so the filled/not-fillable counts cannot be recorded yet.
- [ ] 5.3 Confirm no new permission: the built manifest asks for no `debugger`, and Chrome shows no debugging banner while autofill runs.
      Built manifest asks for `storage`, `tabs`, `sidePanel`, `scripting`, `activeTab`, `identity` — no `debugger`. The banner half needs a live autofill run, so it waits on 5.2's fill half.
